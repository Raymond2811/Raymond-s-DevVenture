## Description

I built this project to showcase I can build a portfolio from scratch and to share a bit of information of myself. 
When creating my portfolio I learned several things like how easy it is to break your website, to plan ahead, and organize your code. 
One of the things I learned from this experience, how to use display flex to create a layout for my images. 
Another thing that I learned was how to use media queries, which allowed me to create responsive designs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

## Usage

My website is simple, doesn't have anything crazy yet. Click on links in the nav bar to direction you to a section. 
There are 3 sections for now. The first being an about me, self-explanatory. 
The second are projects I've worked on so far. Third is my contact information.
