            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Peruvian and I'm 21 years old. I lived in San Bruno, 
                CA all my life. My major was electrical engineer at skyline 
                community college, I was planning to transfer to a UC. Before, 
                the bootcamp I was working at Cutera as an assembler. I've been 
                working since I was like 13 or 14 years old to help my mom. My first job was at a bakery, 
                and I hated that job. Then, when I got a bit older, I worked at JCPenney and Best Buy. 
                I also speak Spanish. In my free time I like to watch movies or shows,
                 play video games, and hang out with my friends. I'm also into anime, some of my favorite shows are
                  One Piece, Naruto, and Vinland Saga. I normally like to play video games on the weekend with
                 my friends. We usually play rainbow six siege, dead by daylight,
                 or some party game like jack box. If we don't feel like playing something, 
                 we end watching a movie together.
